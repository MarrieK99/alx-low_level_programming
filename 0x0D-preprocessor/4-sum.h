/* ABS - Compute the absolute value of a number
 *
 * This macro takes a single argument 'x' and computes its absolute value.
 * If 'x' is less than 0, it negates 'x' to make it positive; otherwise, it keeps 'x' as is.
 *
 * @x: The number for which to compute the absolute value.
 *
 * Return: The absolute value of 'x'.
